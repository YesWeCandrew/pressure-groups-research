# pressure-groups-research
This repository contains my research for the ANU Pressure Groups and Political Lobbying course. I received a High Distinction for my work and was asked to share my code and research with the course convenor, Professor Darren Halpin. My research focused on professionalisation trends within Australian civil and interest groups.
